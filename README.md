# Object-Oriented Programming

This is my personal brief guide to object-oriented programming. I explore and summarize the 4 pillars of oop and how they are implemented across the languages: javascript, python, c++ and java. Included are Practical examples and how they relate closely to the concepts.

I also highlight the nuances among the languages

This may not be a full comprehensive guide, but a revision. If you are a beginner, I will recommend, following the links to the resources attached first. You can use this repo for revision and quick reference.

# Description

There are 4 folders for each of the programming languages I am focusing on. Each folder contain the implementations and links to resources I used to help me understand the concepts.
