## Description

This is my personal brief and quick guide to object-oriented programming. I explore and summarize the 4 pillars of oop and how they are implemented across the languages: javascript, python, c++ and java. Included are practical examples and subtle differences in implementations across the languages.

This is not be a deep comprehensive guide, but a revision note. If you are a beginner, I will recommend following the links to the resources attached first.

## Content

There are 4 folders for each of the programming languages I am focusing on. Each folder contains the implementations and links to resources that helped me understand the concepts.
